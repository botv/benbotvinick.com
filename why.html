      <h3>Why I Dropped My Classes</h3><br>

      November 2020<br><br>

      I've made certain decisions in the past two months that have completely altered the course of my life.<br><br>

      Before I begin to explain, I'd like to acknowledge my motivations here. By nature, I'm not a very public person. I
      actually much prefer that nobody around me has any kind of window into my life, except for my closest friends. To
      that end, I've kept very quiet over the past few months, and have, at some points, been deliberately misleading
      when people have asked me why I dropped three classes and completely withdrew myself socially. There came a point
      when I realized that my current life situation is so tightly coupled with my identity that it's become difficult
      to avoid an explanation in casual conversations. So my motivations here are simple: 1. to avoid the tedious
      explanation of my life situation that has become so unavoidable, 2. to get ahead of any rumors you hyenas have
      been cooking up, and 3. to give you a better idea of why I act the way I do. If this essay comes across as even a
      little bit self-indulgent, please text me, and we can hash it out. Because that's the last thing I want. My number
      is <a href="tel:2158804458">(215) 880-4458</a>.<br><br>

      To understand why I dropped my classes, you first have to understand why I switched schools after freshman year.
      Although being sick of GFS after ten years of meeting for worship (the Quaker practice of gathering as a community
      for an extended period of silent reflection) had something to do with it, my transfer to Milton was much more
      heavily motivated by reckless adventurism. As someone who's counted the days until high school graduation since
      middle school, I was convinced that living in a dorm would be the perfect way of attaining the independence I
      longed for.
      <font color=#dddddd>[<a href="#f1n"><font color=#dddddd>1</font></a>]</font> During my first two years at
      Milton, I pursued every opportunity, made every connection, and took every risk I possibly could have taken.
      Acting again out of an immense desire to transcend high school, I became a freelance web developer, held positions
      at various companies, cofounded two shitty startups (both of which inevitably failed after a few months of
      pickledicking around), and eventually settled into a full-time position at a company I won't name here for reasons
      I won't get into. The value of these experiences was unparalleled, and as I entered college season &mdash; or as
      one of my friends describes it, "The Jungle" &mdash; in the spring of 2020, I was sure that I had done everything
      I possibly could have done in high school to set myself up for a happy life, and the time to move on had finally
      arrived.<br><br>

      Then along came COVID. In the interest of brevity, I will pretend here as if the pandemic's only effect was to
      bestow upon me an abundance of free time, the likes of which I had never experienced before.
      <font color=#dddddd>[<a href="#f2n"><font color=#dddddd>2</font></a>]</font> I filled this void in a number of
      ways, including reconnecting with old friends by spending an inordinate amount of time watching repugnant films
      (e.g. <i>The Kissing Booth</i>) and then critiquing them for hours on end.
      <font color=#dddddd>[<a href="#f3n"><font color=#dddddd>3</font></a>]</font> During the day, I began working on
      a side project building payment infrastructure for online businesses.<br><br>

      My goal for the summer was not to found a startup. My goal for the summer was not to deal with lawyers, hire
      employees, and write code for twelve hours a day, every day. My goal for the summer was not to facilitate half
      a million dollars in consumer transactions in eighteen different countries for five hundred small businesses. None
      of these things were on my summer 2020 bucket list. But they all happened, and by August I was in way over my
      head.<br><br>

      In late September, after working over twelve hours a day for six months, I was offered venture capital to
      pursue the project full-time.
      <font color=#dddddd>[<a href="#f4n"><font color=#dddddd>4</font></a>]</font> In hopes of preserving
      whatever privacy I have left, I will not state the precise amount I was offered, nor by whom (if these details are
      important to you, feel free to text me, my number is listed in the second paragraph). However, because I'm sure
      that many of you are convinced I'm a drama queen at this point, I feel inclined to disclose that the official
      valuation of the company is on the order of a few million dollars.
      <font color=#dddddd>[<a href="#f5n"><font color=#dddddd>5</font></a>]</font><br><br>

      Although I never meant or expected to end up doing what I'm doing, I'm happier than a pig in shit. I get to work
      with the smartest people in the world building a product for customers I love to death, and I get to do it on my
      terms. I wake up in the morning and feel like the captain of a ship I built. But taking money from an investor
      raises the stakes significantly. If I fail, I have to clean up the mess, and if I throw in the towel, I sacrifice
      any hope of raising money from another respectable investor in the future. If I've learned anything since March,
      it's that Hollywood lied. Running a startup is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and the 99% chance of
      failure goes to show just how insane I am to be doing it at all.<br><br>

      The day after graduation, I'm flying out to California and I'm not coming back until I fail. The catch, and the
      reason I'm writing this essay in the first place, is that failure is not the worst-case scenario in my mind. In
      reality, my nightmare is waking up five years from now and realizing that nobody in my life has any idea who I
      am. This essay is step one in my five-year plan to prevent that from happening.<br><br>

      If even one of you read to this point and knows any more about me than you did before, then this was a success.
      Again, my number is <a href="tel:2158804458">(215) 880-4458</a>. Don't be a stranger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <b>Notes</b><br><br>

      [<a name="f1n">1</a>] It's worth acknowledging at this point that I couldn't be more grateful to my parents that
      these were parameters I was able to optimize for to begin with.<br><br>

      [<a name="f2n">2</a>] Again, worth mentioning that I'm fully aware of my privilege here.<br><br>

      [<a name="f3n">3</a>] If you take offense at my use of <i>The Kissing Booth</i> as an example of a repugnant film,
      we should talk. I'm very interested in hearing any argument on its behalf.<br><br>

      [<a name="f4n">4</a>] For those of you who have no idea what this means, investors offered me money like on Shark
      Tank except I wasn't on TV.<br><br>

      [<a name="f5n">5</a>] I'd like to emphasize here that this is not a number I care about, and it's not a number
      you should care about either. A company's valuation is by no means an indicator of its future success. I'm
      happy to explain this in more detail to anyone who's interested.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
