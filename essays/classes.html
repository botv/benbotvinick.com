    <div class="container"><h4>Why I Dropped All My Classes</h4>
      <p>I’ve made certain decisions in the past two months that have completely altered the course
        of my life.</p>
      <p>Before I begin to explain, I‘d like to acknowledge my motivations here. By nature, I’m not
        a very public person. I actually much prefer that nobody around me has any kind of window
        into my life, except for my closest friends. To that end, I’ve kept very quiet over the past
        few months, and have, at some points, been deliberately misleading when people have asked me
        why I dropped three classes and completely withdrew myself socially. There came a point
        where I realized that my current life situation is so tightly coupled with my identity that
        it’s become difficult to avoid an explanation in casual conversation. So my motivations here
        are simple: 1. to avoid the tedious explanation of my life situation that has become so
        unavoidable, 2. to get ahead of any rumors you hyenas have been cooking up, and 3. to give
        you a better idea of why I act the way I do. If this essay comes across even a little bit
        self-indulgent, please text me, and we can hash it out. Because that’s the last thing I
        want. My number is (215) 880-4458.</p>
      <p>To understand why I dropped my classes, you first have to understand why I switched
        schools after freshman year. Although being sick of GFS¹ after ten years of meeting for
        worship (the Quaker practice of gathering as a community for an extended period of silent
        reflection) had something to do with it, my transfer to Milton² was much more heavily
        motivated by reckless adventurism. As someone who’s counted the days until high school
        graduation since middle school, living in a dorm seemed like the perfect way of attaining
        the independence I longed for. I was also convinced that boarding school would be more
        emulative of the college experience.³</p>
      <p>During my first two years at Milton, my personal growth was negligible compared to my
        professional growth. Acting again out of an immense desire to transcend high school, I
        became a freelance web developer, held positions at various Cambridge startups, cofounded
        two shitty companies (both of which inevitably failed after a few months of pickledicking
        around), and eventually settled into a full-time position at a company I won’t name here for
        reasons I won’t get into. The value of these experiences was unparalleled, and as I entered
        college season — or as one of my friends describes it, “The Jungle” — in Spring 2020, I was
        sure that I had done everything I possibly could have done in high school, and the time to
        move on had finally arrived.</p>
      <p>Then along came COVID. In the interest of brevity, I will pretend here as if the
        pandemic’s only effect was to bestow upon me an abundance of free time, the likes of which I
        had never experienced before.⁴ I filled this void in a number of ways, including
        reconnecting with old friends by spending an inordinate amount of time watching repugnant
        films (e.g. The Kissing Booth) and then critiquing them for hours on end.⁵ During the day, I
        began working on a side project building a payment system for online communities.</p>
      <p>My goal for the summer was not to found a startup. My goal for the summer was not to deal
        with lawyers, hire employees, and spend all day answering customer support emails. My goal
        for the summer was not to facilitate half a million dollars in consumer transactions in
        eighteen different countries for five hundred small businesses. None of these things were on
        my summer 2020 bucket list. But they all happened, and by September I was running a company
        from which I couldn’t walk away.</p>
      <p>In late September, after working over twelve hours a day for six months, I was offered
        venture capital.⁶ In hopes of preserving whatever privacy I have left, I will not state here
        how much I was offered, nor from whom (if this is an important detail to you, feel free to
        text me, my number is listed in the second paragraph). But it was enough to convince Milton
        to reduce my graduation requirements and give me the freedom to work full-time.</p>
      <p>Although I never meant or expected to end up doing what I’m doing, I’m happier than a pig
        in shit. I get to work with the smartest people in the world, building software for
        customers I love to death, and I get to do it on my terms. I wake up in the morning and feel
        like the captain of a ship that I built. But taking money from an investor raises the stakes
        significantly. If I fail, I have to clean up the mess, and if I throw in the towel, I
        sacrifice any hope of raising money from any respectable investor ever again.¹ If I’ve
        learned anything since March, it’s that Hollywood lied. Running a startup is by far the
        hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, and the 99% chance of failure goes to show just how
        insane I have to be to do what I’m doing.</p>
      <p>The day after graduation, I’m flying out to California and I’m not coming back until I
        fail. The catch, and the reason I’m writing this essay in the first place, is that failure
        is not the worst-case scenario in my mind. The worst-case scenario is waking up five years
        from now to realize that nobody in my life has any idea who I am. This essay is step one in
        my five-year plan to prevent that from happening.</p>
      <p>If even one of you read to this point and knows any more about me than you did before,
        then this was a success. Again, my number is (215) 880–4458. Don’t be a stranger.</p>

    [1] A small Quaker school in Philadelphia, which I attended from kindergarten through ninth
    grade. [2] A boarding school in Massachusetts which I’ve attended since tenth grade. [3] It’s
    worth acknowledging at this point that I couldn’t be more grateful to my parents that these were
    parameters I was able to optimize for to begin with. [4] Again, worth mentioning that I’m fully
    aware of my privilege here. [5] If you take offense at my use of The Kissing Booth as an example
    of a repugnant film, we should talk. I’m very interested in hearing any argument on its behalf.
    [6] For those of you who have no idea what this means, investors offered me money like on Shark
    Tank except I wasn’t on TV.
